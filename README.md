# Sparse Multi-label Patent Classification with Deep Learning

Alexander Mueller & Kevin Stone

W266 NLP with Deep Learning - Final Project (Fall 2019)

## Project description

The project developed a multi-label classification model capable of categorizing patents into Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) codes.  Classifications are done on the CPC sub-class level and are based on patent abstract texts from the USPTO 2M dataset.
